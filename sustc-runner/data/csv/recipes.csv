I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh.

This is the only way we make turkey, EVER! Especially since oven space is valuable around the holidays.  Why high heat? Heat cooks. Opening the cavity will allow the heat to cook the bird from the inside as well as the outside. Seasoning? Why? Herbs and spices create a crust on the skin that seals in the flavor and juices, you pick what seasoning. Breast side down?  Why? The rack keeps the turkey from steaming on the bottom of the pan. 
Why metal? It conducts heat better than glass or ceramic. Why foil?  High heat can cook too well. Loosely covering the top of the turkey will keep it from burning. Why liquid? To catch the juices and fat as they drip from the turkey so that they will not burn from the high heat of the oven and stick on the bottom of the pan. You will be able to use this liquid as a base for your gravy. 5 rules for HHT:
1) Don't salt!!!!!!!! Why suck the moisture out?

2)Don't let the bird touch the pan! We want to roast, not stew.  When it sits on the bottom of the pan, instead of a rack, or it is squeezed into a too small pan, the hot air is unable to envelop the turkey, causing it to cook in it's own juices

3)Don't Baste the bird! It will break caramelization, slow down cooking and use up the pan juices

4) Don't poke with a fork to turn or check the bird! Piercing the meat will allow the flavorful meat juices to escape

5) Don't cover the bird with cheesecloth! We don't care what Martha says, covering the bird with cheesecloth will prevent browning. It will make a mighty tasting cheesecloth, though, if you are into that kinda thing!



 Then spoon the stuffing in. What about stuffing?

Delighted but humiliated, I asked what the name of the House Soup really was, and they said, &quot;Two Old Queens Soup!&quot; The dining room roared with laughter.

Traditionally made to mark Mothering Sunday, this cake is also known as an Easter Cake; Simnel cake has a fascinating cultural heritage with roots that stretch back to the Romans and Athenians. In Britain, known as the Shrewsbury Simnel, it is simply made using white flour, fragrant spices and is generously studded with dried fruits and pungent peel.

Before preparing the baking dish or any of the other ingredients, measure out the frozen kernels and let them stand at room temperature until needed. When corn is in season, fresh cooked kernels can be substituted for the frozen corn. This recipe was developed with Quaker yellow cornmeal; a stone-ground whole-grain cornmeal will work but will yield a drier and less tender cornbread. A  Pyrex glass baking dish is preferred because it yields a nice golden-brown crust, but a metal baking dish (nonstick or traditional) will also work.

She says that cheesecake is believed to have originated in ancient Greece. The first recorded mention is that it was served to athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776BC !!!  The two main techniques used these days are baked or gelatine based. This one is even easier as it does not use gelatine, does not require baking and only three ingredients are needed for the filling. I haven't made all the variations but I am sure they will be delicious.  I have included 2 variations here and will post another separately.  For the biscuit bases Digestive or plain sweet biscuits eg Nice or Super Wine biscuits seem to be most commonly used. However, try to match your base with filling eg,chocolate chip biscuits with chocolate filling. Chocolate covered biscuits as long as they don't have a chewy filling make a softer textured base that is easy to slice but as the packets weigh less, more than one is needed.

How to Take the Mess Out of Avocados: 
Cut avocados in half; remove pits. Leaving the avocado in the skin, make crosswise cuts through flesh being careful to cut up to, but not through, the skin. Scoop out the avocado with a spoon.

In the summer, when we harvest peaches and blueberries, I make a large batch of the fruit part.  I freeze it in recipe-quantity and then thaw for year-round cobbler.  This recipe starts upside down with the cobbler dough on the bottom of the pan.  The dough will migrate to the top and make a true cobbler crust.  My kids like to watch thru the oven door as this happens.  If you love crust, make a half batch of the fruit and a full batch of the dough.  Cook in a 9x13 pan and you'll have just enough fruit (1/4 inch) to go with the crispy goodness.  It's wonderful warm over vanilla icecream.

London broil   Notes:  This is the name of a finished dish, not a cut of meat, but butchers sometimes assign the name &quot;London broil&quot; to the following cuts:  flank steak, top round steak, or top blade steak.  Each would work well in a London broil recipe.  

According to foodsubs.com a London broil is actually the name of a finished dish, but this cut is sometimes given that name. A London broil cut is actually a top round steak, aka butterball steak, which are thick steaks cut from the top round. You could also use an equal size flank steak but I have never used that cut for this.

But for a main course, you may want to add meat to the pot.  Bacon or chorizo or even hamburger will work.  If using hamburger, saut&eacute; first.  *Research in recent years by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture shows that a simple procedure in preparation will eliminate 80% of the gas caused in eating beans. Complex sugars are that element and can be dissolved out in the soaking water by following this method.
1. Add the washed beans to a large pot with at least 3 times as much boiling water.

I also don't use banana leaves...too much cash and I'm here to save you some money. Trust me, the pork tastes just as good as the leaves are only for show.

Let me also say that Annatto is also known as &quot;Achiote Seed&quot;. You can get it at any Spanish market in the city in which you live...and I would ALSO recommend using the powder version of ANY of the spices with the exception of cloves and all-spice berries.

My pork is also hotter because I'm a spice-nut.

Last, but not least, the pork: get it de-boned by your butcher or deli clerk. This takes a minute or less at the store and is VERY worth it. Otherwise, you will spend a LONG time trying to cut around a hand-sized bone inside the meat.

I also like to marinate the meat overnight which is the reason this recipe takes HOURS to prepare. If this isn't your thing, one to two hours will do as well but an overnight stay in your fridge will allow the juices to better penetrate the meat.

Also, you want the following items:

1) Coffee/spice grinder
2) 1 Large Chef's Knife/Santoku
3) Blender
4) Measuring Cup/Spoons
5) 1 1/2 Gallon Ziploc Bags
6) Casserole or Baking Dish
7) Aluminum Foil (the big, wide foil, not standard)
8) Rubber gloves (for cutting the peppers; if you don't have these, use plastic bags to go over your hands)

If you have a coffee grinder, make sure you're not gonna use it for making coffee in the near future because your coffee will have that spice taste. 

If you don't have a coffee/spice grinder, you CAN use a blender to grind your spices.

(the little piece of paper is still taped to the inside of one of my kitchen cabinet doors), but didn't know the amounts which he said was up to the preparer.

Attributed to &quot;Marcella Says . . . Italian Cooking Wisdom From the Legendary Teacher's Master Classes, With 120 of Her Irresistible New Recipes&quot; (HarperCollins, 2004), by Marcella Hazan.
FYI -  If grinding the meat sounds too involved, spare yourself &amp; opt for either ground chicken or turkey. Both are readily available &amp; relatively inexpensive. San Marzano canned tomatoes are available from CA - no need to spend on imported (or try with Muir Farms fire roasted canned tomatoes for a splurge).
Per the article, &quot;Dante Bernardis uses the name Blasut both for himself and for his restaurant in Lavariano, a Friuli farmland town. Dante makes this pasta sauce with young roosters, which are tastier than hens. To achieve comparable flavor with what is available in the meat counter of most markets, I have used chicken thighs, the tastiest part of the bird. The liberal use of herbs, unusual in most Italian cooking, makes the sauce intensely aromatic and endows it with a depth of flavor that one generally associates with game. It is excellent on sturdy pasta shapes, such as penne.&quot; There you go. Chicken - it's what's for supper.

3451,Barbecue Lasagna,7229,cullinanpat,PT45M,PT1H,PT1H45M,2009-03-01T18:11:00Z,"Years ago, Mid 1990 I think. I was sitting around talking about how the Pizza chains had come out with BBQ Pizza when I got the idea of BBQ Lasagna. I was inspired by the pizza, my Italian family upbringing and my southern living as an adult. This may sound strange at first but everyone I have served it to for the past 10+ years loved it. I start by cooking a large 6-10 lb Boston Butt on the smoker ahead of time slicing off some for a diner and then pulling the rest for pulled pork sandwiches and of course BBQ Lasagna. If you are already accustomed to pulled pork you are ahead of the game. If not there are many great smoked Boston Butt/pulled pork recipes on the web.  If this seams like way to much work (smoking/ barbequing is a sport and requires lots of time and beer) then there is ready made pulled pork alternatives sold in most grocery stores that could be used.  Here is one I see in the stores. Lloyd’s BBQ Pork, search lloydsbbq.com http://www.lloydsbbq.com/products_shredporkbbq.aspI have not tried this but I’m sure it would be pretty good. I will stick with smoking and pulling my own.  The same can be said for BBQ sauce. There is lots of good recipes on the web or use your favorite store bought brand. You can go spicy or sweet the choice is fully yours. Fact is you will find that you can vary this entire recipe many different ways using your favorite Lasagna recipe if you already have one. I like to think of this more as an Idea then a recipe. You can even trade out BBQ pulled Chicken, Beef etc. I will not use exact measurements for the pork or BBQ sauce as like I said I always make a lot and use what is left for other meals. I would guess I use somewhere between 1-2 lbs of pork in the Lasagna. I mix plenty of BBQ sauce to my pulled pork in a sauce pan and bring it to a slow simmer. (Don’t burn) You just want the meat good and wet with the sauce and enough to simmer but not so much it is soupy. It should be very meaty. On the flip side if you choose a real thick sauce you may need to add a little water to thin it out. You’re looking for the same consistency as a traditional marinara sauce to spread easily and be soaked up by the lasagna.",Pork,"c(""ricotta cheese"", ""egg"", ""salt"", ""black pepper"", ""pre-shredded mozzarella cheese"", ""cheddar cheese"")",5.0,2.0,577.7,32.5,19.7,128.7,731.3,37.1,1.5,1.7,33.2,,

Try to use fresh herbs in this if you have them. And please people, don't substitute cottage cheese for ricotta, it's not the same thing. Nor should the ricotta be fat free. I've made double and triple batches of this, sometimes I use Italian sausage along with meatballs. If you do, cook the sausage in the microwave for about 5 minutes then cut in half and drop in the sauce to finish cooking. This is my favorite way to cook Italian sausage, the texture is great and it gives a lot of flavor to the sauce. Once the sausage is cooked (about 25 minutes), cut into bite sized pieces to put in the dish. A note on the meatballs, I like a combination of beef and pork, which you can find at the butcher labeled 'Meatloaf Mix'. The ratio in this is 1:1 pound each: pasta, meatballs, ricotta, mozzarella. If I make a double batch it's two pounds of pasta, meatballs.....you get the idea. The best part of this is the top crust of crispy pasta and cheese.

For the bee hoon, just prepare the pork first, then add in chopped veggies (cabbage, carrots). After soaking your bee hoon in hot water for 10 minutes, throw the lot in and fry. Add more oyster sauce (till the noodles are a light brown) and you're good to go!

Tetsuya's is considered Australia's best restaurant and has routinely been ranked in the top 20 in the world (http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1&amp;item_id=55). 

Australia has an abundance of fresh fish and seafood, so a saltwater fish, prepared with a minimum of fuss, is a very traditional Australian preparation.

Substitutions and variations: You can substitute marlin, tuna or bonito for the swordfish. You can substitute a relatively neutral oil with a high smoke point for the grapeseed oil -- I have used canola oil successfully. I use low sodium chicken stock. You can augment (or substitute for) the tomato with tomato paste.

Wakame is available in dried form in most oriental grocery stores or via the Internet. To prepare dried wakame, wipe very lightly with a damp paper towel, then soak in room temperature water for no more than 60 seconds. &quot;Rocket&quot; is the UK (and Australian) term for arugula.

Janet says &quot;Eating the right meal within an hour or two after excercise could make the biggest difference you've noticed yet. That's the time when your body needs - and most effectively uses - food to turn your effort into stronger muscles and increased energy levels. It's also when you burn fat most effectively. Eggs are a concentrated source of muscle-building amino acids and other body-building nutrients. They're also rich in vitamin K, which helps to heal bruises and other minor sports injuries. This vitamin works by ensuring that blood is able to clot normally, so it could also reduce the danger of blood clots in arteries.&quot;
The original recipe called for groundnut oil, but I think butter would work just fine - or any other oil you have on hand.

I have been doing this for some twenty years.  Now, I will give you my recipe to serve 12, but just cut it in half or a third and add what you want.  This recipe isn't about exact amounts, but more about the method and order of cooking.  These are what I like to add, but if you don't like or can't afford the lobster, add more snow crab, shrimp, clams or mussels. So don't worry, what ingredients you have, but follow the order that everything is cooked.  My ingredients include:  onions, potatoes, corn on the cob, kielbasa or smoked sausage, artichokes, lemons, lobster tails, clams, mussels, snow crab and shrimp. Don't think you need a lobster tail per person, but I do 1/2 corn cob and 3 small potatoes per per person and 1/2 sausage (more sausage if I know there is not a lot of seafood lovers) and then the seafood. So this is my process for 12. I cook mine for this amount in a turkey cooker with water, beer and Old Bay seasoning, The turkey cooker than has a strainer so it is easy to drain, but a small pot on the stove will work for a small group of 3-4.  Remember ... Rule of thumb 2-3 small red potatoes, 1/2 - 1 sausage link, 1 artichoke heart, 1/2 cob of corn, 1/2 onion, and then seafood per person, so just add what you can. Personally, I could eat 2 lobster tails, my dad 1 lb or more shrimp, and my best friend, all the mussels, so just do a little of everything, and I think they will be all very happy.  Now, it sounds like a lot, but the entire dinner cooked in one pot. Just melt some butter, cocktail sauce on the side and a some grilled or baked bread. Cover your table with newspaper and pour it all in the center and let everyone just help themselves.  Simple paper plates. We eat everything with plastic, except for a crab cracker and small pick to get the crab meat out. Rolls of paper towels on the table and just relax and have fun. You can also add some sour cream for the potatoes, salt and pepper of course and maybe some dijon mustard for the sausage if you wanted, but there is so much flavor I never find that necessary, but add what you like. Don't try to make it fancy ... just enjoy. When done, pack up the leftovers and plates right in the center of the table, wrap up the newspaper and throw away.

And boursin cheese or a soft cheese with chives. Simply grilled and so worth it. Now at the restaurant they also served this cold, but just about everyone ordered it grilled.

Margat qeema is traditionally associated with the holy month of Muharram (the first in the Islamic lunar calendar year). On ‘ashour -- the tenth day of this month -- this stew along with rice, hareesa (wheat porridge), and zarda w’haleeb (yellow and white rice pudding) are distributed to neighbors and passers-by in commemoration of the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed, and religious leader at the time. When he went to Kufa to press his claim to the caliphate, he was killed in battle on the plains of Karbala on the tenth day of Muharram.

REVIEW by A Cook from Brooklyn on 11/16/09:
I had split peas in my kitchen, and purchased a ham hock. Never used one before. For everyone who have not - be warned - it provides great flavor, but it very, very smokey. I am not crazy about it. I think it would be more successful to use a ham bone instead. This recipe is also very similar to French Canadian Pea Soup. I wish I had seen this video prior to embarking on a 2-3 hour soup-making venture, with mediocre results.

There are so many ways to make it.  It&rsquo;s said that if you had thirty Spanish cooks in the kitchen, there would be thirty different versions of gazpacho!  We are adding a quick step of sauteing the garlic in olive oil first before adding to the blender of veggies. This really enhances the fresh garlic flavor.  We&rsquo;re serving ours with a medley of chopped vegetables for garnish.  You might be wondering why our gazpacho&rsquo;s a blush color instead of a vivid red?

Replicating this look is simple. Use a third of the dough to make braids and shape the rest into a ball. Then ring the braids around the outside of the ball.

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
The perfect buttermilk coleslaw recipe would produce a salad with crisp, evenly cut pieces of cabbage lightly coated with a flavorful buttermilk dressing that would cling to the cabbage instead of collecting in the bottom of the bowl. We found that salting and draining the cabbage removed excess water and wilted it to a pickle-crisp texture. For a dressing that was both hefty and tangy, we combined buttermilk, mayonnaise, and sour cream.

BUT  with the family being on separate diets at the moment this just fitted the bill ...... with everyone.  I used  both normal and  G.F. pasta, in this dish separately.... AND both G.F. and not loved it.
Another find from the Weekly Time's, although adapted to G.F. although I am posting as written.
NOTES FROM RECIPE--
There are reasons that pasta exists in so many forms: it's partly regional (Italian cities big and small always seem to have a specialty pasta), but it's also practical (certain pastas are best eaten with certain sauces). 

And a brief over overview. of the recipe posted --
The general rule is that delicate noodles are for delicate sauces while heartier noodles are for heartier sauces. But similar to wine pairing, it's not always that simple. 

Of course, these are guidelines, not rules, and you can play with combinations as you wish.

The way you cook pasta can also vary. Baking pasta in the oven, or cooking it in large pots of water are just two options. Some pasta can even be cooked risotto-style.


WHICH PASTA TO CHOOSE

Ridged tubes (penne, rigatoni). This is everyone's favourite pasta, a versatile shape that's a nice medium size and holds lots of sauce in its external ridges and internal hollows. 

Corkscrews (fusilli). Fantastic with pesto, tomato or meat sauces. Like the ridged pastas, the advantage of the corkscrew shape is that it &quot;catches&quot; the sauce. 

Hollow spaghetti (bucatini). These are essentially very long, thin straws. The classic sauce for these hearty pastas is all'amatriciana. 

Spaghetti. Spaghetti is perfect with tomato-based marinara and bolognese sauces. 

Flattened forms of spaghetti - pappardelle, fettucine, and linguine - come a close second.

Skinny spaghetti - angel-hair pasta - does best with thinner sauces, such as puttanesca.

Butterflies (farfalle, bow-tie pasta). This is perhaps the most fanciful of pasta shapes, best with a light-to-medium sauce or soup where the shape can stand out. 

Macaroni. Though macaroni has a less-than-exotic image, this is perhaps the most versatile of pastas, good with sauces or baked in casseroles. 

Stuffed pasta (ravioli, tortellini). Usually filled with cheese, meat, vegetables, or a combination thereof. 

Tiny pasta (orzo, cous cous). Frequently seen in pasta salads, orzo is a small, rice-shaped pasta often found in the Greek lemon-egg soup called avgolemono.",< 60 Mins,"c(""butter"", ""onion"", ""gemelli pasta"", ""pasta"", ""carrots"", ""parmesan cheese"", ""parsley"")",,,876.2,25.6,13.0,62.8,1094.5,125.1,7.9,18.0,34.8,,

As well as being beautiful to look at, this soup is also rich and creamy from the addition of coconut milk and homemade chicken stock. The other vegetables &ndash; carrots, leeks, and sweet potato &ndash; complement the flavor of the squash without overwhelming it, so the star of the show gets its chance to shine.
